    <h1>About Breast Cancer</h1>
        <p class="center"> Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Australian women and the second most common cancer that causes female deaths after lung cancer.</p>
        <p>Breast cancer is an abnormal growth of cells lining the lobules or ducts of the breast. These cells grow uncontrollably and may spread to other parts of the body. Both men and women can develop breast cancer, but it is not common in men. Transgender women and non-binary women may also develop breast cancer. </p>
        <p>It is estimated that by 2021, 19,866 women and 164 men in Australia will be diagnosed with breast cancer. </p>
        <p>In Australia, the overall five-year survival rate for women with breast cancer is 91%. If the cancer is limited to the breast, 96% of patients are still
              alive within five years after diagnosis; this number does not include those who have died of other diseases. If the cancer has spread to the 
              regional lymph nodes, the five-year relative survival rate will drop to 80%. </p>

    <h1>Treatments</h1>
    <h2>Treatment for breast cancer usually depends on the extent of the cancer. A few common treatments are:</h2>
    <div class="col three">
      <h1 class="feature side">Staging</h1>
      <p class="side">Staging involves assessing the size of the breast cancer and whether it has spread to the draining lymph nodes under the arm. A CT scan of the chest and liver and bone scan are done to check the sites to which breast cancers most commonly spread.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col three">
      <h1 class="feature side">Surgery</h1>
      <p class="side">For localised breast cancer, the most extensive surgical option is to remove the breast and lymph nodes under the arm. Radiotherapy is generally recommended after breast surgery.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col three">
      <h1 class="feature side">Chemotherapy</h1>
      <p class="side">Chemotherapy may be used to help shrink the cancer before surgery, if the risk of cancer returning is high or if cancer returns after surgery or radiation therapy. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="group margin"></div>
    <div class="col three">
      <h1 class="feature side">Radiation therapy (radiotherapy) </h1>
      <p class="side">Radiation therapy is recommended after breast-surgery to help destroy any undetected cancer. It is also recommended if lymph nodes were removed under the arm and there is a risk that the cancer will return to this area. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col three">
      <h1 class="feature side">Hormone therapy</h1>
      <p class="side">Hormone therapy uses drugs to reduce the levels of female hormones in the body. This helps to stop or slow the growth of hormone receptor positive cancer cells. The type of hormone therapy you have will depend on your age, the type of breast cancer and whether you have reached menopause.
</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col three">
      <h1 class="feature side">Targeted therapy </h1>
      <p class="side">Targeted breast cancer drugs attack specific targets inside cancer cells. The drugs that are currently available are only useful for HER2 positive breast cancer.</p>

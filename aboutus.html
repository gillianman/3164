    <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p class="center"> Predict breast cancer is a web-based interface that can advise clients of early stages of breast cancer using mammography. </p>
        <p class="center">Our predictive model aims to uplift the current standard of early stage breast cancer detection through the use of deep 
              learning to assist medical professionals make more informed decisions in treating potential patients with cancer.  </p>

    <h1>How does it work?</h1>
     <p class="center"> Our predictive model is a machine learning model that combines both classical machine learning and deep learning techniques, 
           specifically Conventional Neural Network (CNN), to develop an accurate predict model for early breast cancer detections. </p>
     <p class="center">The model has been tested to make sure that the estimates it produces are as accurate as possible. It was originally developed 
           using data from over ???? women with breast cancer. Itâ€™s predictions were then tested on data from another ???? women to make sure 
           that they gave the best estimate. </p>
     <p class="center">Although our model produces good estimates, it cannot 100% guarantee its results as it aims to consult and assist medical professions only. </p>
